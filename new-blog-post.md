# Joe Root's Century Seals Epic England Victory at Lord's!

What a match! England clinched a nail-biting victory against India in the third test at Lord's, winning by three wickets in a thrilling contest. The hero of the hour? None other than England captain Joe Root, who smashed his 37th test century at the iconic ground. It was a captain's knock for the ages, guiding his team to a crucial win in the series.

Root's performance was not just about the runs; it was about resilience and leadership. He praised Ben Stokes for his inspirational leadership, highlighting the positive environment within the team. Reflecting on his own form, Root admitted he felt he hadn't quite hit his peak in the series yet, making this century even more significant. "It was nice to contribute and um felt like I' I've not quite given my best throughout this series as yet. So nice to to get, you know, get in the series if you like and um and make a valuable contribution which has led to a great result for us," he said in a post-match interview. This knock certainly felt like him hitting his stride!

The battle between Root and India's Jasprit Bumrah was a captivating subplot to the match. Root acknowledged the tough contest, noting that Bumrah has dismissed him 11 times in his career. However, Root relishes these challenges, stating his desire to compete against the best and perform at his highest level. This competitive spirit is what makes test cricket so compelling, and Root's hunger to face the best is truly admirable.

Looking ahead, Root mentioned that the team will take a well-deserved week off to refresh and recharge before the next test match in Manchester. This break will be crucial for the players to recover both physically and mentally after a physically and emotionally taxing test. With the series finely poised, expect both teams to come out firing on all cylinders in Manchester. Can England continue their momentum, or will India bounce back? Only time will tell!
