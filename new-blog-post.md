# Goa or Bust: Atheism, Aloo Puri, and Altered Plans

The rain is relentless today, the kind that seeps into your bones and makes every decision feel monumentally harder. To add to the delightful ambiance, the Kawar Yatra is in full swing, turning the roads into a chaotic ballet of devotion and disruption. My initial plan was simple: drive to Delhi, catch a flight to Goa, and soak up some much-needed sunshine. But Mother Nature and logistical nightmares had other ideas. The drive to Delhi seemed increasingly treacherous, so, after a bit of mental wrestling, I've decided to ditch the road trip and fly directly to Goa. Sometimes, you just gotta roll with the punches, right?

This morning, after a solid workout to shake off the decision fatigue, my thoughts drifted to something completely different: Bhagat Singh's atheism. It’s a topic that always sparks a fascinating internal debate. He questioned the very essence of a divine being allowing so much suffering in the world. As someone who *is* a believer, I find myself constantly grappling with the same questions. Where's the justification for pain and hardship if there's a benevolent force watching over us? Singh's arguments, though challenging, hold a certain weight. It forces you to seek rational explanations, to look beyond blind faith and find a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it. It's not about abandoning belief, but about enriching it with critical thought.

The rest of the day has been a mix of the mundane and the mindful. A heavy strength training session always helps clear the head. Then, a quick check-in with the stock market – keeping a close eye on Trans Rail, in particular. And then, the ultimate indulgence: aloo puri and a sandwich for breakfast! Definitely not my usual fare, but sometimes you need a little comfort food to combat the chaos. It's these small deviations from routine that make life interesting, isn't it?

So, Goa is officially on the horizon. Flight confirmed for tomorrow. Time to trade this incessant rain for some sunshine, and perhaps ponder the mysteries of the universe while sipping a cocktail on the beach. Stay tuned!
